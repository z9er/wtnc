# Installation Issues

<details>
<summary>Vortex: The Fallback Installer popped up, what should I do?</summary>

This usually means an extension isn't properly installed. Check that all Vortex extensions are up to date in the Extensions section.

<details>
<summary>Vortex: I cannot see the mod settings menu in-game</summary>

This is caused by REDmod autoconversion being enabled:

1. Go to Settings â†’ V2077 Settings
2. Ensure "Automatically convert old-style 'archive' mods to REDmods on install" is OFF
3. Remove all mods (keep archives)
4. Reinstall the collection

<summary>Wabbajack: It can't find Cyberpunk 2077</summary>

Common causes:
- Wabbajack and the game are on different drives
- You haven't verified game files after cleaning
- Game hasn't been launched once through Steam/GOG/Epic

<summary>Vortex: A mod is stuck on "pending" during installation</summary>

Simply restart Vortex - it will continue where it left off.
