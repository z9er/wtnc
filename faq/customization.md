# Modlist Customization

<details>
<summary>Can I add mods to this list?</summary>

Yes, but:
- Avoid other gameplay overhauls
- Skip HD texture packs if you have <8GB VRAM
- Never add mods that modify REDscript
- Test thoroughly

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is [specific mod] compatible?</summary>

Check if it:
- Uses REDmod (usually incompatible)
- Modifies core gameplay systems
- Has known conflicts listed

When in doubt, ask in our Discord.

<summary>I added HD textures and my game crashes</summary>

You're exceeding VRAM. Remove HD texture mods or reduce texture quality in settings.

<summary>Can I use reshade?</summary>

At your own risk. Known to cause map crashes with certain versions.

<summary>Why aren't there body/clothing mods?</summary>

Personal preference varies too much. We provide the framework - add whatever aesthetic mods you prefer.
