### Ensuring Clean Game Install

1. Go to your **"appdata"** folder by searching windows and typing **%appdata%**

2. In **"AppData"** folder go to **"Local,"** and in this folder delete the **"CD Projekt Red"** and **"Red Engine"** folders

3. Go to your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory and delete **all** folders except for **"archive"**
   > If you've ever modded Cyberpunk before, it's important to ensure you have a clean game folder

4. Additionally delete the **"mod"** folder in **"Cyberpunk 2077/archive/pc/"**

5. Verify your game files through **Steam**, **GOG** or **Epic**
