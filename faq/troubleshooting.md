# Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>My game is loading very slowly</summary>

Ensure the game is installed on an SSD, not an HDD. Cyberpunk 2077 with mods requires fast storage for acceptable load times.

</details>

<details>
<summary>I don't see the minimap</summary>

If you're using Cyberpunk THING, the minimap is hidden by default. Press F6 to toggle it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>There's a stutter every 5 seconds</summary>

This can be caused by third-party overlays or the Stock Market mod. Try disabling overlays first.

</details>

<details>
<summary>I'm getting a missing TweakDB error</summary>

1. Navigate to your game folder
2. Delete these folders: "r6", "red4ext", "bin", "engine"
3. Verify game files
4. Reinstall the collection

</details>

<details>
<summary>Red4ext is giving me an error</summary>

Install Visual C++ Redistributables from Microsoft. Both x64 and x86 versions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When I crouch, time skip appears</summary>

This is Immersive Timeskip. You can change the keybind in:
- Vortex: `Cyberpunk 2077/r6/input/ImmersiveTimeskip.xml`
- Wabbajack: In MO2, find Immersive Timeskip and edit the XML

</details>

<details>
<summary>Invalid input appears next to my quickhacks</summary>

You need to bind quickhack hotkeys. Open CET console and go to Quickhack Hotkeys settings.

</details>

<details>
<summary>The radio keeps playing after I leave the car</summary>

This is the RadioPort feature added in 2.0. Hold the radio button to turn it off.
